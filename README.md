# PlotlyLightLite


[![Build Status](https://github.com/jverzani/PlotlyLightLite.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/jverzani/PlotlyLightLite.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)


`Plots`-like access to `PlotlyLight` for the graphs of Calculus using Plotly.

This package is intended as an alternative to `Plots` for resource-constrained environments, such as `binder`. The `Plots` interface to `Plotly`; the `PlotlyJS` package; and the `PlotlyLight` package are all richer and more flexible.
